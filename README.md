# Econ211_decisiontree_sj288

The decision tree visualization classifies the purchasing power of different cities around the world in terms of their property price to income ratio. The property price to income ratio data has been broken down into four classes: very high, high, low and very low based on its range whereas the purchasing power index shows purchasing power in buying goods and services in the given city for the average net salary in that city relative to the purchasing power of New York City. If domestic purchasing power is 60, this means that the inhabitants of that city with an average salary can afford to buy on an average 40% less goods and services than New York City residents with an average salary.
